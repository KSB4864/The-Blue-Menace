GAME SUMMARY: 

You are the blue menace, a figmentation of all of the world's water, he is trying to escape a post apocalyptic strange land. 
You can control the blue menace with the arrow keys, use left and right to move, and up to jump. 
The goal of this game is to beat every level as fast as possible, time your self on each stage, and compete with friends for faster times.
WHENEVER YOU DIE, YOU HAVE TO CLOSE OUT THE GAME AND DOUBLE CLICK THE TITLE SCREEN (osmTS.py)
